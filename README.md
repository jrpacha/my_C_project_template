#### Sources ####
I wrote this template to use it in my own projects and I copied a lot of the stuff from the following sources:

* http://make.mad-scientist.net/papers/advanced-auto-dependency-generation/ (see references therein)
* https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Prerequisites.html (see references therein)
* http://nuclear.mutantstargoat.com/articles/make/ by John Tsiombikas nuclear@member.fsf.org

So all the credits go to these guys!!!
