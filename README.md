I wrote this 'template' to use it in my own projects. It is by no means an original work, for it is based in the following sources:

* http://make.mad-scientist.net/papers/advanced-auto-dependency-generation/ (see references therein)
* https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Prerequisites.html (see references therein)
* http://nuclear.mutantstargoat.com/articles/make/ by John Tsiombikas nuclear@member.fsf.org

So all the credit to this guys!!!
